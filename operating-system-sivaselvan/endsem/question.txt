Highway 110 is a two-lane north-south road that passes through a one-lane tunnel. A car can safely
enter the tunnel if and only if there are no oncoming cars in the tunnel. To prevent accidents, sensors
installed at each end of the tunnel notify a controller computer when cars arrive or depart the tunnel in
either direction The controller uses the sensor input to control signal lights at either end of the tunnel.
Show how to implement the controller program correctly using mutexes and condition variables. You
may assume that each car is represented by a thread that calls Arrive() and Depart() functions in the
controller, passing an argument indicating the direction of travel. You may also assume that Arrive()
can safely stop the arriving car by changing the correct signal light to red and blocking the calling
thread. Your solution should correctly handle rush hour, during which most cars approach the tunnel
from the same direction. your solution should be free from starvation and deadlock
