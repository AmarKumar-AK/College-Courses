A pizza company wants to open its delivery centres across a very big city.
The challenges they will face is that they need to analyse areas from where
pizza is being ordered frequently. 
They need to figure out the locations for the pizza stores within all
these areas in order to keep the distance between the store and delivery
points minimum.
Resolving these challenges includes a lot of analysis and 
mathematics. we would learn here about how clustering can provide a 
meaningful and easy method of sorting out such real life challenges.
